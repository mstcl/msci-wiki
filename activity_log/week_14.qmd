## Tasks

- [x] Regenerate datasets without the rolling to reduce filesizes and complexity
- [ ] Quantify where cluster distribution stabilises

## No rolling

To remove the extra snapshots (look at [Week 5](./week_5.qmdk) for an
explanation of this), we remove the final loop in `sampler.py`, create a new
version for this, which we named sampler_no_roll.py, and regenerated the
datasets, each only 66 MB in size (reduced from 220 MB!).

A one-liner for this:

```bash
for i in $(seq 0.0.5 0.05 0.5); do python3 sampler_no_roll.py --odd --density $i; done
```
