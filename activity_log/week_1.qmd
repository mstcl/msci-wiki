## Tasks

- [x] Catch up on background reading
- [x] Set up electronic notebook
- [x] Set up git repository for shared knowledge
  - Personal logs and files in `.gitignore`
  - How to resolve conflicts? Avoid editing at the same time?
  - Where to host? Private GitHub repo?
- [ ] Set up a GitHub organisation (a single repo might not cover the whole
project). *To be discussed when a more concrete project is decided*. (Moved to
next week)

## Summary

There were some texts to read through, we were also given a brief of the
project and different directions we can take it.

We agreed to make an electronic notebook using Quarto and git. Brief guide
documenting how to set it up is found [here](../shared/repo.qmd).
