## From previous week

-   [x] Set up a GitHub organisation (a single repo might not cover the whole
    project).

## Tasks

-   [x] Clone and comment [this
    repo](https://github.com/FTurci/persistent-exclusion-process).
    -   [New forked
        		repo](https://github.com/dlactivematter/persistent-exclusion-process), with
        		comments and docstrings added.
-   [x] Write short intro (about 500 words) about why we study active matter,
    with references.
    -   [See here](../writings/motivation.qmd).

## Summary

-   This week, the main task was to comb through introductory literature, and
    produce a writeup on motivation to study active matter.

-   There was also some code to comment and look through (from the
    persistent-exclusion-process (PEP) repo).

-   The other task was to sort out HPC access. CP & I have access to BlueCrystal
    and BluePebble, accordingly.
