	abstract = "Active systems, which are driven out of equilibrium by local
	            non-conservative forces, can adopt unique behaviors and
	            configurations. An important challenge in the design of novel
	            materials, which utilize such properties, is to precisely connect
	            the static structure of active systems to the dissipation of
	            energy induced by the local driving. Here, we use tools from
	            liquid-state theories and machine learning to take on this
	            challenge. We first analytically demonstrate for an isotropic
	            active matter system that dissipation and pair correlations are
	            closely related when driving forces behave like an active
	            temperature. We then extend a nonequilibrium mean-field framework
	            for predicting these pair correlations, which unlike most
	            existing approaches is applicable even for strongly interacting
	            particles and far from equilibrium, to predicting dissipation in
	            these systems. Based on this theory, we reveal a robust analytic
	            relation between dissipation and structure, which holds even as
	            the system approaches a nonequilibrium phase transition. Finally,
	            we construct a neural network that maps static configurations of
	            particles to their dissipation rate without any prior knowledge
	            of the underlying dynamics. Our results open novel perspectives

	            collective behavior of a larger number of identical agents. The
	            scale of agents ranges from nanomotors and microswimmers, to
	            cells, fish, birds, and people. Inspired by biological
	            microswimmers, various designs of autonomous synthetic nano- and
	            micromachines have been proposed. Such machines provide the basis
	            for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent (artificial)
	            active materials, which exhibit emergent behavior and the ability
	            to perform tasks in response to external stimuli. A major
	            challenge for understanding and designing active matter is their
	            inherent nonequilibrium nature due to persistent energy
	            consumption, which invalidates equilibrium concepts such as free
	            energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry. Unraveling,
	            predicting, and controlling the behavior of active matter is a
	            truly interdisciplinary endeavor at the interface of biology,
	            chemistry, ecology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. The

	            a major challenge. Hence, to advance, and eventually reach a

	            active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments.
	            This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and
	            statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and
	            molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile
	            microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical
	            imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several
	            approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to
	            phenomenological. In particular, first considered are “dry”
	            systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to
	            friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The
	            differences and similarities between two types of orientationally
	            ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next,
	            the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or “wet” systems is
	            discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case,
	            as well as various large-scale instabilities of these
	            nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further
	            highlighted are various large-scale instabilities of these
	            nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic
	            derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected,
	            highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum
	            model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these
	            theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the
	            cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is
	            discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in
	            specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are
	            suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter
	            analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of
	            active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with
	            controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or
	            artificial constituents, is summarized.",

	            continuous injection of energy at the microscale. The field of
	            active matter focuses on understanding how the collective
	            behaviours of internally driven components can give rise to these
	            biological phenomena, while also striving to produce synthetic
	            materials composed of active energy-consuming components. The
	            synergistic approach of studying active matter in both living

	            building blocks has the potential to transform our understanding

	            that operate away from equilibrium and can thus attain life-like
	            properties. In this Review, we focus on active materials made of
	            cytoskeletal components, highlighting the role of active stresses
	            and how they drive self-organization of both cellular structures
	            and macroscale materials, which are machines powered by
