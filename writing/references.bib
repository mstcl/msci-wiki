	abstract = {Active Brownian particles (ABPs, such as self-phoretic colloids) swim at fixed speed v along a body-axis u that rotates by slow angular diffusion. Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs, such as motile bacteria) swim with constant u until a random tumble event suddenly decorrelates the orientation. We show that when the motility parameters depend on density ρ but not on u, the coarse-grained fluctuating hydrodynamics of interacting ABPs and RTPs can be mapped onto each other and are thus strictly equivalent. In both cases, a steeply enough decreasing v(ρ) causes phase separation in dimensions d = 2,3, even when no attractive forces act between the particles. This points to a generic role for motility-induced phase separation in active matter. However, we show that the ABP/RTP equivalence does not automatically extend to the more general case of u-dependent motilities.},

We then turn our attention specifically to those models for which the exact distribution of microstates in the steady state can be expressed in a matrix-product form. In addition to a gentle introduction to this matrix-product approach, how it works and how it relates to similar constructions that arise in other physical contexts, we present a unified, pedagogical account of the various means by which the statistical mechanical calculations of macroscopic physical quantities are actually performed. We also review a number of more advanced topics, including nonequilibrium free-energy functionals, the classification of exclusion processes involving multiple particle species, existence proofs of a matrix-product state for a given model and more complicated variants of the matrix-product state that allow various types of parallel dynamics to be handled. We conclude with a brief discussion of open problems for future research.},

We show how this form enables one to analyse in detail condensation transitions, wherein a finite fraction of particles accumulate at a single site. We review condensation transitions in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and also summarize recent progress in understanding the dynamics of condensation.

This non-Brownian diffusion is characterized by a random walk with a finite persistence length between changes of direction and is inspired by the motion of bacteria such as E. coli. By defining a class of models with multiple species of particles and transmutation between species we can recreate such dynamics. These models admit exact analytical results whilst also forming a counterpart to previous continuum models of run-and-tumble dynamics. We solve the externally driven non-interacting and zero-range versions of the model exactly and utilize a field-theoretic approach to derive the continuum fluctuating hydrodynamics for more general interactions. We make contact with prior approaches to run-and-tumble dynamics off lattice and determine the steady state and linear stability for a class of crowding interactions, where the jump rate decreases as density increases. In addition to its interest from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, this lattice model constitutes an efficient tool to simulate a class of interacting run-and-tumble models relevant to bacterial motion, so long as certain conditions (that we derive) are met.},

We hypothesize that the intriguing ability of lymphocytes to avoid jamming and clogging is in part attributable to the dynamic shape changes that cells undergo when they move. In this work, we test this hypothesis by investigating an idealized system, namely, the flow of self-propelled, oscillating particles passing through a narrow constriction in two dimensions (2D), using numerical simulations. We found that deformation allows particles with these properties to flow through a narrow constriction in conditions when non-deformable particles would not be able to do so. Such a flowing state requires the amplitude and frequency of oscillations to exceed threshold values. Moreover, a resonance leading to the maximum flow rate was found when the oscillation frequency matched the natural frequency of the particle related to its elastic stiffness. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been described previously. Our findings could have important implications for understanding and controlling flow in a variety of systems in addition to lymphoid organs, such as granular flows subjected to vibration.},

	abstract = {Active matter systems are driven out of equilibrium by conversion of energy into directed motion locally on the level of the individual constituents. In the spirit of a minimal description, active matter is often modeled by so-called active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles an extension of passive Brownian motion where activity is represented by an additional fluctuating non-equilibrium “force” with simple statistical properties (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). While in passive Brownian motion, entropy production along trajectories is well-known to relate to irreversibility in terms of the log-ratio of probabilities to observe a certain particle trajectory forward in time in comparison to observing its time-reversed twin trajectory, the connection between these concepts for active matter is less clear. It is therefore of central importance to provide explicit expressions for the irreversibility of active particle trajectories based on measurable quantities alone, such as the particle positions. In this technical note we derive a general expression for the irreversibility of AOUPs in terms of path probability ratios (forward vs. backward path), extending recent results from [PRX 9, 021009 (2019)] by allowing for arbitrary initial particle distributions and states of the active driving.},

They can be transformed into a system of underdamped particles under additional velocity dependent forces and subject to white noise forces. There has been some discussion in the literature on whether AOUPs can be in equilibrium for particular interaction potentials and how far from equilibrium they are in the limit of small persistence time. By using a theorem on the time reversed form of the AOUP Langevin-Ito equations, I prove that they have an equilibrium probability density invariant under time reversal if and only if their smooth interaction potential has zero third derivatives. In the limit of small persistence Ornstein-Uhlenbeck time \${\textbackslash}tau\$, a Chapman-Enskog expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation shows that the probability density has a local equilibrium solution in the particle momenta modulated by a reduced probability density that varies slowly with the position. The reduced probability density satisfies a continuity equation in which the probability current has an asymptotic expansion in powers of \${\textbackslash}tau\$. Keeping up to \$O({\textbackslash}tau)\$ terms, this equation is a diffusion equation, which has an equilibrium stationary solution with zero current. However, \$O({\textbackslash}tau{\textasciicircum}2)\$ terms contain fifth and sixth order spatial derivatives and the continuity equation no longer has a zero current stationary solution. The expansion of the overall stationary solution now contains odd terms in the momenta, which clearly shows that it is not an equilibrium.},

We formulate and study a class of lattice-based models for multiple walkers with motion persistence and spatial exclusion in one and two dimensions, and use a mean-field approximation to investigate relevant population-level partial differential equations in the continuum limit. We show that this model of a persistent exclusion process is in general well described by a nonlinear diffusion equation. With reference to results presented in the current literature, our results reveal that the nonlinearity arises from the combination of motion persistence and volume exclusion, with linearity in terms of the canonical diffusion or heat equation being recovered in either the case of persistence without spatial exclusion, or spatial exclusion without persistence. We generalize our results to include systems of multiple species of interacting, motion-persistent walkers, as well as to incorporate a global drift in addition to persistence. These models are shown to be governed approximately by systems of nonlinear advection-diffusion equations. By comparing the prediction of the mean-field approximation to stochastic simulation results, we assess the performance of our results. Finally, we also address the problem of inferring the presence of persistence from simulation results, with a view to application to experimental cell-imaging data.},

	abstract = {Rod-shaped particles, 370 nm in diameter and consisting of 1 μm long Pt and Au segments, move autonomously in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions by catalyzing the formation of oxygen at the Pt end. In 2−3\% hydrogen peroxide solution, these rods move predominantly along their axis in the direction of the Pt end at speeds of up to 10 body lengths per second. The dimensions of the rods and their speeds are similar to those of multiflagellar bacteria. The force along the rod axis, which is on the order of 10-14 N, is generated by the oxygen concentration gradient, which in turn produces an interfacial tension force that balances the drag force at steady state. By solving the convection-diffusion equation in the frame of the moving rod, it was found that the interfacial tension force scales approximately as SR2γ/μDL, where S is the area-normalized oxygen evolution rate, γ is the liquid−vapor interfacial tension, R is the rod radius, μ is the viscosity, D is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen, and L is the length of the rod. Experiments in ethanol−water solutions confirmed that the velocity depends linearly with the product Sγ, and scaling experiments showed a strong dependence of the velocity on R and L. The direction of motion implies that the gold surface is hydrophobic under the conditions of the experiment. Tapping-mode AFM images of rods in air-saturated water show soft features that are not apparent in images acquired in air. These features are postulated to be nanobubbles, which if present in hydrogen peroxide solutions, would account for the observed direction of motion.},

	abstract = {Rod-shaped particles, 370 nm in diameter and consisting of 1 μm long Pt and Au segments, move autonomously in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions by catalyzing the formation of oxygen at the Pt end. In 2−3\% hydrogen peroxide solution, these rods move predominantly along their axis in the direction of the Pt end at speeds of up to 10 body lengths per second. The dimensions of the rods and their speeds are similar to those of multiflagellar bacteria. The force along the rod axis, which is on the order of 10-14 N, is generated by the oxygen concentration gradient, which in turn produces an interfacial tension force that balances the drag force at steady state. By solving the convection-diffusion equation in the frame of the moving rod, it was found that the interfacial tension force scales approximately as SR2γ/μDL, where S is the area-normalized oxygen evolution rate, γ is the liquid−vapor interfacial tension, R is the rod radius, μ is the viscosity, D is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen, and L is the length of the rod. Experiments in ethanol−water solutions confirmed that the velocity depends linearly with the product Sγ, and scaling experiments showed a strong dependence of the velocity on R and L. The direction of motion implies that the gold surface is hydrophobic under the conditions of the experiment. Tapping-mode AFM images of rods in air-saturated water show soft features that are not apparent in images acquired in air. These features are postulated to be nanobubbles, which if present in hydrogen peroxide solutions, would account for the observed direction of motion.},

	abstract = {With the increasing size and frequency of mass events, the study of crowd disasters and the simulation of pedestrian flows have become important research areas. However, even successful modeling approaches such as those inspired by Newtonian force models are still not fully consistent with empirical observations and are sometimes hard to calibrate. Here, a cognitive science approach is proposed, which is based on behavioral heuristics. We suggest that, guided by visual information, namely the distance of obstructions in candidate lines of sight, pedestrians apply two simple cognitive procedures to adapt their walking speeds and directions. Although simpler than previous approaches, this model predicts individual trajectories and collective patterns of motion in good quantitative agreement with a large variety of empirical and experimental data. This model predicts the emergence of self-organization phenomena, such as the spontaneous formation of unidirectional lanes or stop-and-go waves. Moreover, the combination of pedestrian heuristics with body collisions generates crowd turbulence at extreme densities—a phenomenon that has been observed during recent crowd disasters. By proposing an integrated treatment of simultaneous interactions between multiple individuals, our approach overcomes limitations of current physics-inspired pair interaction models. Understanding crowd dynamics through cognitive heuristics is therefore not only crucial for a better preparation of safe mass events. It also clears the way for a more realistic modeling of collective social behaviors, in particular of human crowds and biological swarms. Furthermore, our behavioral heuristics may serve to improve the navigation of autonomous robots.},

Remarkably, continuous deterministic descriptions do not account for this difference, which is only recovered at the fluctuating hydrodynamics level. Scalar and vectorial order parameters indeed produce different types of number fluctuations, which we show to be essential in selecting the inhomogeneous patterns.

	abstract = {Bacteria release and sense small molecules called autoinducers in a process known as quorum sensing. The prevailing interpretation of quorum sensing is that by sensing autoinducer concentrations, bacteria estimate population density to regulate the expression of functions that are only beneficial when carried out by a sufficiently large number of cells. However, a major challenge to this interpretation is that the concentration of autoinducers strongly depends on the environment, often rendering autoinducer-based estimates of cell density unreliable. Here we propose an alternative interpretation of quorum sensing, where bacteria, by releasing and sensing autoinducers, harness social interactions to sense the environment as a collective. Using a computational model we show that this functionality can explain the evolution of quorum sensing and arises from individuals improving their estimation accuracy by pooling many imperfect estimates – analogous to the ‘wisdom of the crowds’ in decision theory. Importantly, our model reconciles the observed dependence of quorum sensing on both population density and the environment and explains why several quorum sensing systems regulate the production of private goods.},

In contrast to living systems, where quorum sensing is determined by biochemical processes, the behaviour of synthetic active particles can be controlled by external fields. Accordingly they allow to investigate how variations of a density-dependent particle response affect their self-organisation. Here we experimentally and numerically demonstrate this concept using a suspension of light-activated active particles whose motility is individually controlled by an external feedback-loop, realised by a particle detection algorithm and a scanning laser system. Depending on how the particles’ motility varies with the density of neighbours, the system self-organises into aggregates with different size, density and shape. Since the individual particles’ response to their environment is almost freely programmable, this allows for detailed insights on how communication between motile particles affects their collective properties.},

            Whereas self-propelled hard discs undergo motility-induced phase separation, self-propelled rods exhibit a variety of nonequilibrium phenomena, including clustering, collective motion, and spatio-temporal chaos. In this work, we present a theoretical framework representing active particles by continuum fields. This concept combines the simplicity of alignment-based models, enabling analytical studies, and realistic models that incorporate the shape of self-propelled objects explicitly. By varying particle shape from circular to ellipsoidal, we show how nonequilibrium stresses acting among self-propelled rods destabilize motility-induced phase separation and facilitate orientational ordering, thereby connecting the realms of scalar and vectorial active matter. Though the interaction potential is strictly apolar, both, polar and nematic order may emerge and even coexist. Accordingly, the symmetry of ordered states is a dynamical property in active matter. The presented framework may represent various systems including bacterial colonies, cytoskeletal extracts, or shaken granular media.},

Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.},

This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenological. In particular, first considered are “dry” systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or “wet” systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs.

	abstract = {Active matter systems are driven out of equilibrium at the level of individual constituents. One widely studied class are systems of athermal particles that move under the combined influence of interparticle interactions and self-propulsions, with the latter evolving according to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process. Intuitively, these so-called active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) systems are farther from equilibrium for longer self-propulsion persistence times. Quantitatively, this is confirmed by the increasing equal-time velocity correlations (which are trivial in equilibrium) and by the increasing violation of the Einstein relation between the self-diffusion and mobility coefficients. In contrast, the entropy production rate, calculated from the ratio of the probabilities of the position space trajectory and its time-reversed counterpart, has a non-monotonic dependence on the persistence time. Thus, it does not properly quantify the departure of AOUPs systems from equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Active systems, which are driven out of equilibrium by local non-conservative forces, can adopt unique behaviors and configurations. An important challenge in the design of novel materials, which utilize such properties, is to precisely connect the static structure of active systems to the dissipation of energy induced by the local driving. Here, we use tools from liquid-state theories and machine learning to take on this challenge. We first analytically demonstrate for an isotropic active matter system that dissipation and pair correlations are closely related when driving forces behave like an active temperature. We then extend a nonequilibrium mean-field framework for predicting these pair correlations, which unlike most existing approaches is applicable even for strongly interacting particles and far from equilibrium, to predicting dissipation in these systems. Based on this theory, we reveal a robust analytic relation between dissipation and structure, which holds even as the system approaches a nonequilibrium phase transition. Finally, we construct a neural network that maps static configurations of particles to their dissipation rate without any prior knowledge of the underlying dynamics. Our results open novel perspectives on the interplay between dissipation and organization out of equilibrium.},

Its basic origin is simple: since self-propelled particles accumulate where they move slowly, having a propulsion speed that decreases steeply enough with density, due to collisions or chemical interactions, leads to a feedback loop that induces the formation of a dense phase. In these notes, I will discuss some of the main theoretical and computational efforts that have been made over the last decade in understanding the basic structural and dynamical properties of MIPS phase coexistence in microscopic active particle models.},

	abstract = {Activity and autonomous motion are fundamental in living and engineering systems. This has stimulated the new field of ‘active matter’ in recent years, which focuses on the physical aspects of propulsion mechanisms, and on motility-induced emergent collective behavior of a larger number of identical agents. The scale of agents ranges from nanomotors and microswimmers, to cells, fish, birds, and people. Inspired by biological microswimmers, various designs of autonomous synthetic nano- and micromachines have been proposed. Such machines provide the basis for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent (artificial) active materials, which exhibit emergent behavior and the ability to perform tasks in response to external stimuli. A major challenge for understanding and designing active matter is their inherent nonequilibrium nature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidates equilibrium concepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry. Unraveling, predicting, and controlling the behavior of active matter is a truly interdisciplinary endeavor at the interface of biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. The vast complexity of phenomena and mechanisms involved in the self-organization and dynamics of motile active matter comprises a major challenge. Hence, to advance, and eventually reach a comprehensive understanding, this important research area requires a concerted, synergetic approach of the various disciplines. The 2020 motile active matter roadmap of Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter addresses the current state of the art of the field and provides guidance for both students as well as established scientists in their efforts to advance this fascinating area.},
