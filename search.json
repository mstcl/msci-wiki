    "text": "An active matter system is characterised by its constituent self-propelling and self-directional units that are individually capable of extracting and dissipating free energy to result in complex, systematic behaviours [1]. Allowing a material to exchange energy with its environment and interact with other particles can result in a system far from equilibrium [2,3].  However, unlike other standard non-equilibrium systems, energy exchanges in active systems responsible for driving the system out of equilibrium are at the level of individual particle’s contribution, as opposed to effects at the system’s boundaries [1]. The properties of active systems are often emergent collective properties that provide intriguing studies,  from self-motility, synchronous dynamics [4], order-disorder transitions, pattern formation, swarming, and lots more.\nNumerous examples of active systems can be found in biological systems at all scales, from fish in a school  and birds in a flock, to algae, bacteria, proteins [4] and actin and microtubules in subcellular domains [1].\n\nThere are several reasons to study active systems. For once, it could reveal new physics, as the domain of non-equilibrium systems is not fully well-understood.  In applications, it allows us to borrow or mimic strategies from biological systems in order to create to new synthetic materials, devices, robotics and medicine [2].\nOne effective way to study active matter is to model it in vitro or in silico.  However, the overall high complexity of living systems means providing a theoretical description with generality is not entirely achievable [1]; the parameter space to be taken into account is far from minimal, let alone in non-equilibrium.  However, with appropriate approximations [5], it remains fruitful to study emergent collective behaviour of minimal systems in both physical and computational setting (e.g. synthetic nanomachine and numerical modelling).  While we can study emergent behaviours, out of these models, one challenge is to address the inverse problem; to determine the rules that lead to a desired collective state [6], with one motivation being to control such systems in applications. In this domain, powerful tools like machine learning can be deployed to build a robust framework analogous to equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, ultimately with the aim of providing fundamental insight into a microscopic-emergent connection [7]. \n\nIn addition, studies of active matter as materials yield a catalogue of generic properties and behaviours, many of which are universal [1] when examined as collective properties such as orders, phases, phase transitions [3].  Devising these universal classes has many useful implications. For the engineers and manufacturers, this allows for reliable imitations without the need of biological components, and for the biologists and ecologists, it is interesting to match the generalized behaviours of systems in vitro to living systems in vivo, unveiling group-level properties that are independent of the type of animal or its scale [8]. For the theoreticians, it allowsbetter fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium systems.\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\n[1] M. C. Marchetti, J. F. Joanny, S. Ramaswamy, T. B. Liverpool, J.

This page should be as standardised and explanatory as possible; when deemed necessary, examples should be given alongside the basic command structure.\n\n\n2. Cloning\nWhen cloning a repository, use:\ngit clone git@github.com:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;\nIf you didn’t use ssh url while cloning, change remote before pushing:\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;\nFor instance, cloning the persistent exclusion process example script:\ngit remote set-url origin git@github:dlactivematter/persistent-exclusion-process.git\nIf in doubt, use the following to show all the available remotes:\ngit remote -v\n\n\n3. Basic Git Commands\nCheck which branch you are on (and also other available branches):\ngit status\nAdd new file to current branch\ngit add &lt;filename&gt;\nCommit new file to current branch (prompts adding a commit comment)\ngit commit &lt;filename&gt; \nPush all changes to branch\ngit push origin &lt;branch&gt;\n\n\n4.
