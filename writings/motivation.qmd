An active matter system is characterised by its constituent self-propelling and
self-directional units that are individually capable of extracting and
dissipating free energy to result in complex, systematic
behaviours[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]. Allowing material to exchange energy
with its environment and interact with other particles can result in a system
far from equilibrium[@bechinger_active_2016;@ramaswamy_mechanics_2010].
However, unlike other standard non-equilibrium systems, energy exchanges in
active systems responsible for driving the system out of equilibrium is at the
level of individual particle's contribution, as opposed to effects at the
system's boundaries[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]. The properties of active
systems are often emergent collective properties that provide intriguing
studies, from self-motility, synchronous dynamics[@decamp_what_nodate],
order-disorder transitions, pattern formation, swarming, and lots more.

Examples of active systems can be found largely in biological systems at all
scales, from fish in a school and birds in a flock, to algae, bacteria,
proteins[@decamp_what_nodate] and actin and microtubules in subcellular
domains[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013].

There are several reasons to study active systems. For once, it could reveal
new physics, as the domain of non-equilibrium systems is not fully
well-understood. In applications, it allows us to borrow or mimic strategies
from biological systems in order to create to new synthetic materials, devices,
robotics and medicine[@bechinger_active_2016].

One effective way to study active matter is to model it _in vitro_ or _in
silico_. However, the overall high complexity of living systems means providing
a theoretical description with generality is not entirely
achievable[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]; the parameter space to be taken into
account is far from minimal, let alone in non-equilibrium. However, with
appropriate approximations[@flenner_active_2020], it remains fruitful to study
emergent collective behaviour of minimal systems in both physical and
computational setting (e.g. synthetic nanomachine and numerical modelling).
While we can study emergent behaviours, out of these models, one challenge is
to address the inverse problem; to determine the rules that lead to a desired
collective state[@gompper_2020_2020], with one motivation being to control such
systems in applications. In this domain, powerful tools like machine learning
can be deployed to build a robust framework analogous to equilibrium
statistical thermodynamics, ultimately with the aim of providing fundamental
insight into a microscopic-emergent connection[@rassolov_predicting_2022].

In addition, studies of active matter as materials yield a catalogue of generic
properties and behaviours, many of which are
universal[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013] when examined as collective properties
such as orders, phases, phase transitions[@ramaswamy_mechanics_2010]. Devising
these universal classes have many useful implications. For the engineers and
manufacturers, this allows for faithful imitations without the need of
biological components, and for the biologists and ecologists, it is interesting
to match the generalized behaviours of systems _in vitro_ to living systems _in
vivo_, unveiling group-level properties that are independent of the type of
animal or its scale[@buhl_disorder_2006]. For the theoreticians, it allows
better fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium systems.
