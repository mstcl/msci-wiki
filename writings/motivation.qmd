## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

An active matter system is characterised by its constituent self-propelling and
self-directional units that are individually capable of extracting and
dissipating free energy to result in complex, systematic
behaviours[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]. The context of which these active
systems emerge has been found in disordered systems, soft matter, as well as
statistical mechanics, both at and out of equilibrium.


Numerous examples of active systems can be found in biological systems at all
scales, from fish in a school[@yang_dominating_2022] and birds in a flock, to
algae, bacteria, proteins[@decamp_what_nodate] and actin and microtubules in
subcellular domains[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]. The general properties of
active systems are often emergent collective properties that provide intriguing
phenomena, from self-motility, synchronous dynamics[@decamp_what_nodate],
order-disorder transitions, pattern formation, swarming, and lots more.

## Real-world applications<a name="real-world-applications"></a>

First, in practical applications, we might want borrow or mimic strategies from
biological systems, with the goal of creating new synthetic materials, devices,
robotics and medicine[@bechinger_active_2016]. Here, the use of models is
integral to provide insight into how to engineer synthetic systems. For this,
the models are performed both _in vitro_ (nanomachines) and _in silico_
(numerical modelling). Although active systems have a parameter space far from
minimal, by using appropriate approximations to form our models, even with
minimal ones, we can seek to derive large-scale
generality[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013; @flenner_active_2020]. These systems
have group-level properties derived from macroscopic orders, phases, and phase
transitions, that are independent of the scale of its constituents.


For instance, a good yet minimal approximation would be a model by Viscek _et.
al_[@buhl_disorder_2006; @vicsek_novel_1995]. Here, clustering is induced
through a combination of self-propulsion and self-orientation in response to
its neighbours. The system evolves with a two-step iteration process, and the
whole system is controlled by 3 parameters. Yet, its central prediction shows
phase transition from disordered, individual motion to ordered, collective
motion, dictated through its minimal set of parameters[@buhl_disorder_2006].


While it cannot be assumed that the models used _in vitro_ translate directly
to what is observed in reality, they are still crucial components that when
combined with more sophisticated rules or understanding from other fields,
would enable useful real-world applications, an example being controlling
insect pest outbreaks[@buhl_disorder_2006].

## New physics at non-equilibrium<a name="new-physics-at-non-equilibrium"></a>

While we can study emergent behaviours, one challenge out of these models is to
address the inverse problem; to determine the rules that lead to a desired
collective state[@gompper_2020_2020]. In this domain, powerful tools like
machine learning can be deployed to build a robust framework analogous to
equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, ultimately with the aim of providing
fundamental insight into a microscopic-emergent
connection[@rassolov_predicting_2022].

Non-equilibrium results when energy exchanges and dissipation at the level of
individual particles' contribution lead to irreversibility
within[@bechinger_active_2016;@ramaswamy_mechanics_2010]. This is contrasted
with at-equilibrium systems, where energy effects are found at the system's
boundaries[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]. Whereas we have the laws of
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in the latter type of systems that
tell us about their macrostates (from their energy) and likelihood (from their
Boltzmann distribution), it is not clear for the former type of systems. The
difficulty lies in constructing analogues to these theories using quantities
equivalent to the system's free energies. Therefore, new physics can emerge
in studying this so not-well understood phenomena.
