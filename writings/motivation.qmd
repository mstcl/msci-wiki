An active matter system is characterised by its constituent self-propelling and
self-directional units that are individually capable of extracting and
dissipating free energy to result in complex, systematic
behaviours[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]. Allowing material to exchange energy
with its environment and interact with other particles can result in a system
far from equilibrium[@bechinger_active_2016;@ramaswamy_mechanics_2010].
However, unlike other standard non-equilibrium systems, energy exchanges in
active systems responsible for driving the system out of equilibrium is at the
level of individual particle's contribution, as opposed to effects at the
system's boundaries[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]. The properties of active
systems are often emergent collective properties that provide intriguing
studies, from self-motility, synchronous dynamics[@decamp_what_nodate],
order-disorder transitions, pattern formation, swarming, and lots more.

Examples of active system can be found largely in biological systems at all
scales, from fish in a school and birds in a flock, to algae, bacteria,
proteins[@decamp_what_nodate] and actin and microtubules in subcellular
domains[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013].

There are many ways in which the study of active matter is a point of interest.
For once, it could reveal new physics in coming up with theories to explain
these systems, as well as pointing to further investigations when it comes to
more exotic systems. In applications, it could be a way to borrow or mimic
strategies from biological systems to create to new synthetic materials,
devices, robotics and medicine[@bechinger_active_2016].

One effective way to study active matter is to model it _in vitro_ or _in
silico_. However, the overall high complexity of living systems means providing
a theoretical description with generality is not
achievable[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013]; the parameter space to be taken into
account is far from minimal, let alone in non-equilibrium. However, with
appropriate approximations[@flenner_active_2020], it remains fruitful to study
emergent collective behaviour of minimal systems in both physical and
computational setting. Out of these models, one challenge is the inverse
problem; to determine the rules that lead to a desired collective
state[@gompper_2020_2020], with one motivation being to control such systems in
applications. In this domain, powerful tools like machine learning can be
deployed to build a robust framework analogous to equilibrium statistical
thermodynamics, with the aim of providing insight a microscopic-to-emergent
connection[@rassolov_predicting_2022].

In addition, emerging from studies of active matter as materials yield a
catalogue of generic properties and behaviours, many of which are
universal[@marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013] if examined as orders, phases, phase
transitions[@ramaswamy_mechanics_2010]. For the engineers and manufacturers,
this allows for faithful imitations without the need of biological components,
and for the biologists and ecologists, it is interesting to match the these
generalized behaviours of systems _in vitro_ to living systems _in vivo_,
unveiling group-level properties that are independent of the type of animal or
its scale[@buhl_disorder_2006]. For the theoreticians, it allows better
fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium systems.
